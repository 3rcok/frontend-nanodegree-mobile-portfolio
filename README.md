## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

I downloaded the source code from https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio

### Steps to optimise the portfolio
1. downloaded some images from web to local, optimised images by using tinypng.com
2. used inline css
3. moved perfmatters.js to html
4. used grunt to minify javascript and css
5. replaced images on index.html with sprites
