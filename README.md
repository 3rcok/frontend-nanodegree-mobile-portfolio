## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

I downloaded the source code from https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio

### Steps to optimise the portfolio
1. downloaded some images from web to local, optimised images by using tinypng.com
2. used inline css
3. moved perfmatters.js to html
4. used grunt to minify javascript and css
5. replaced images on index.html with sprites
6. used a variable to cache the scrolltop value in main.js file to improve the frames per second

Testing the performance

1. The improved portfolio can be accessed on http://3rcok.github.io/mobile-portfolio/
2. To test the page speed I used the following sites:
    * https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights
3. To check the frames per second I used Google Developer Tools
